    <p id="ipl">Sporting Club East Bengal (Bengali pronunciation: [ˈi:st ˌbenˈɡɔːl]) is an Indian professional football club based in the city of Kolkata, West Bengal. Founded in 1920, the club competes in the Indian Super League, the top flight of Indian football, as well as the Calcutta Premier Division A, the oldest football league in Asia.

        Founded in August 1920, the club became affiliated with the Indian Football Association in 1922 before earning promotion to the Calcutta Football League first division in 1924. East Bengal won their first league title in 1942 and have since gone on to win the title a record 39 times. The club was also a founding member of the National Football League in 1996 and has won the league title three times.[4] They have also won eight Federation Cups, three Super Cups, a record 29 IFA Shield titles, and a record 16 Durand Cup titles, making the club one of the most decorated in Indian football.
        
        The club is mainly supported by the immigrant population from the eastern region of Bengal (known as Bangal), who were forced to leave their homes during the partition of 1947. For those people, East Bengal Club became a source of identity and hope. The huge influx of dispossessed into the state led to a socio-economic crisis in the state. This led to rivalries among the immigrant population and native population of West Bengal in every sphere of life from jobs, and business, to schools and even on football pitches. As a result, East Bengal has a long-standing rivalry with its cross-town competitors Mohun Bagan (now ATK Mohun Bagan), which is mainly supported by the native population, with whom it competes in the Kolkata derby, Asia's biggest football rivalry. East Bengal also shares a local rivalry with another Kolkata club, Mohammedan. The club dons the iconic red and gold colours, which give it the nickname of Red and Gold Brigade.
